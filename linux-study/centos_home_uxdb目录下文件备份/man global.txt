       global -u[qv]

DESCRIPTION
       Global  finds  locations  of given symbols in C, C++, Yacc, Java, PHP and Assembly
       source files, and prints the path name, line number and line image  of  the  loca‐
       tions.   Global can locate not only definitions but also references and other sym‐
       bols.

       Global can treat a source tree, that is, a directory that has sub-directories  and
       source  files,  as  a project.  In advance of using this command, you must execute
       gtags(1) at the root directory of the project which you  want  to  investigate  to
       make  tag  files.   Then  you can use global command anywhere in the project.  You
       need not specify where the tag file is.  Instead, global locates it by itself.

       You can specify a regular expression for pattern.  Global understands two  differ‐
       ent versions of regular expression syntax: basic and extended (default).

COMMANDS
       The following commands are available:

       <no command> pattern
              No  command  means  tag search command.  Print tags which match to pattern.
              By default, print definition tags.

       -c, --completion [prefix]
              Print symbols which start with prefix.  If prefix is not given,  print  all
              symbols.

       -f, --file files
              Print all tags in the files.  This command implies the -x option.

       -g, --grep pattern [files]
              Print  all lines which match to the pattern.  If files are given, this com‐
              mand searches in those files.

       --help Print a usage message.

       -I, --idutils pattern
              Print all lines which match to pattern.  This function uses idutils(1) as a
              search engine.  To use this command, you need to install idutils(1) in your
              system and execute gtags(1) with the -I option.

       -P, --path [pattern]
              Print path names which match to pattern.  If no pattern is given, print all
              paths in the project.

       -p, --print-dbpath
              Print location of ´GTAGS´.

       --print name
              Print  location  of  name, which may be one of: ´root´, ´dbpath´ or ´conf´.
              ´root´ means project's root directory. ´dbpath´ means a directory where tag
              databases exist. ´conf´ means configuration file.

       -u, --update
              Update  tag files incrementally.  This command internally invokes gtags(1).
              You can execute this  command  anywhere  in  the  project,  differing  from
              gtags(1).

       --version
              Show version number.

OPTIONS
       The following options are available:

       -a, --absolute
              Print absolute path names. By default, print relative path names.

       --color when
              Use  color  to  highlight  the pattern within the line; when may be one of:
              never, always or auto (default).  The default color is  bold  red  text  on
              current  background;  the  environment variable GREP_COLORS (only mt and ms
              are effective at present) or GREP_COLOR defines it.  This option is  effec‐
              tive to the following commands: <no command>, -f, -g, -I, -P.

       -d, --definition
              Print locations of definitions.

       -e, --regexp pattern
              Use pattern as the pattern; useful to protect patterns starting with ´-´.

       -E, --extended-regexp
              Interpret pattern as a extended regular expression.  This is the default.

       --encode-path chars
              Convert  path  characters  in chars into a ´%´ symbol, followed by the two-
              digit hexadecimal representation of the character.  A blank  will  be  con‐
              verted to ´%20´.

       -F, --first-match
              End  the search without going through all the tag files listed in GTAGSLIB‐
              PATH when tags are found in a tag file. This is the default.

       --from-here context
              Decide tag type by context. Its syntax should  be  ´lineno:path´.   If  the
              context  is  a  definition  of the pattern then use -r, else if there is at
              least one definition of the pattern then use -d,  else  use  -s.   If  this
              option  is  specified  then  -d, -r and -s on the command line are ignored.
              Regular expression is not allowed for pattern.  This option assumes use  in
              conversational environments such as editors and IDEs.

       -G, --basic-regexp
              Interpret  pattern  as  a  basic  regular  expression.   The  default is an
              extended regular expression.

       --gtagsconf file
              Set environment variable GTAGSCONF to file.

       --gtagslabel label
              Set environment variable GTAGSLABEL to label.

       -i, --ignore-case
              Ignore case distinctions in the pattern.

       -L, --file-list file
              Obtain files from file in addition to the arguments.  The argument file can
              be set to '-' to accept a list of files from the standard input. File names
              must be separated by newline.

       -l, --local
              Print only tags which exist under the current directory.

       --literal
              Execute literal search instead of regular expression search.   This  option
              works with the tag search command, -g command, -P command and -I command.

       -M, --match-case
              Search is case-sensitive. This is the default.

       --match-part part
              Specify  how  path  name  completion  should  match,  where part is one of:
              ´first´, ´last´ or ´all´ (default).  This option is valid only with the  -c
              command in conjunction with -P.

       -n, --nofilter
              Suppress sort filter and path conversion filter.

       -N, --nearness[=start]
              Use  Nearness  sort  method (sorting by closest from start) for the output.
              By default, alphabetical sort method is used.  This option is effective for
              the tag search command, -P command and -g command. As an exception, -g com‐
              mand ignores this option when files are specified by arguments.  The  near‐
              ness  is  defined by how many parent directories to go up to reach the tar‐
              get. The  result  of  nearness  sort  is  concatenation  of  the  following
              ([0]-[n]) in this order. The default of start is the current directory.
              [0] If the start is a file, output of local search in the file.
              [1] Output of local search in the start directory except for [0].
              [2] Output of local search in the parent directory except for [0]-[1].
              [3] Output of local search in the grandparent directory except for [0]-[2].
              ... (repeat until the project root directory)
              [n] Output of local search in the project root directory except for [0]-[n-1].
              In each directory, they are sorted by alphabetical order.

       -O, --only-other
              Treat  only  text files other than source code, like ´README´.  This option
              is valid only with the -g or -P command.   This  option  overrides  the  -o
              option.

       -o, --other
              Treat  not  only  source  files but also text files other than source code,
              like ´README´.  This option is valid only with the -g or -P command.

       --path-style format
              Print path names using format, which may be one of: ´relative´, ´absolute´,
              ´shorter´,  ´abslib´  or ´through´.  ´relative´ means relative path. ´abso‐
              lute´ means absolute path.  ´shorter´ means the shorter one of relative and
              absolute  path.   ´abslib´ means absolute path for libraries (GTAGSLIBPATH)
              and relative path for the rest.  ´through´ means the relative path from the
              project  root  directory (internal format of GPATH).  The default is ´rela‐
              tive´.  The --path-style option is given more priority than the -a option.

       --print0
              Print each record followed by a null character instead of a newline.

       -q, --quiet
              Quiet mode.

       -r, --reference, --rootdir
              Print reference tags.  Reference means the reference to a symbol which  has
              definitions.  With the -p option, print the root directory of the project.

       --result format
              Print  out  using  format,  which may be one of: ´path´ (default), ´ctags´,
              ´ctags-x´, ´grep´ or ´cscope´.   The  --result=ctags  and  --result=ctags-x
              options are equivalent to the -t and -x options respectively.  The --result
              option is given more priority than the -t and -x options.

       --single-update file
              Update tag files using gtags(1) with the  --single-update  option.   It  is
              considered  that file was added, updated or deleted, and there is no change
              in other files.  This option implies the -u option.

       -s, --symbol
              Print other symbol tags.  Other symbol means  the  reference  to  a  symbol
              which has no definition.

       -S, --scope dir
              Print  only  tags which exist under dir directory.  It is similar to the -l
              option, but you need not change directory.

       -T, --through
              Go through all the tag files listed  in  GTAGSLIBPATH.   By  default,  stop
              searching  when tag is found.  This option is ignored when either -s, -r or
              -l option is specified.

       -t, --tags
              Use standard ctags format.

       -V, --invert-match
              Invert the sense of matching, to select non-matching lines.  This option is
              valid only with the -g or -P commands.

       -v, --verbose
              Verbose mode.

       -x, --cxref
              Use standard ctags cxref (with -x) format.

FILES
       ´GTAGS´
              Tag file for definitions.

       ´GRTAGS´
              Tag file for references.

       ´GPATH´
              Tag file for source files.

       ´GTAGSROOT´
              If environment variable GTAGSROOT is not set and file ´GTAGSROOT´ exists in
              the same directory as ´GTAGS´ then global sets GTAGSROOT to the contents of
              the file.

       ´gtags.conf´, ´$HOME/.globalrc´
              Configuration data for GNU GLOBAL.  See gtags.conf(5).

ENVIRONMENT
       The following environment variables affect the execution of global:

       GREP_COLOR
              The color to use for --color; GREP_COLORS has precedence.

       GREP_COLORS
              The color (mt or ms) to use for --color; see grep(1).

       GTAGSBLANKENCODE
              If this variable is set, the --encode-path=" <TAB>" option is specified.

       GTAGSCACHE
              The size of the B-tree cache. The default is 50000000 (bytes).

       GTAGSCONF
              Configuration file.

       GTAGSDBPATH
              The  directory  in  which  the tag files exist.  This value is ignored when
              GTAGSROOT is not defined.  Use of this variable is not recommended.

       GTAGSFORCECPP
              If this variable is set, each file whose suffix is ´.h´ is treated as a C++
              source file.

       GTAGSLABEL
              Configuration label. The default is default.

       GTAGSLIBPATH
              If this variable is set, it is used as the path to search for library func‐
              tions. If the given symbol  is  not  found  in  the  project,  global  also
              searches  in these paths.  Since only ´GTAGS´ is targeted in the retrieval,
              this variable is ignored when -r or -s is specified.

       GTAGSLOGGING
              If this variable is set, ´$GTAGSLOGGING´ is used as the path name of a  log
              file. There is no default value.

       GTAGSROOT
              The  root directory of the project.  Usually, it is recognized by existence
              of ´GTAGS´.  Use of this variable is not recommended.

       GTAGSTHROUGH
              If this variable is set, the -T option is specified.

       GTAGSOBJDIR, MAKEOBJDIR
              If eigher of the two variable is set, it is used as the name  of  BSD-style
              objdir.  The former is given priority. The default is ´obj´.

       GTAGSOBJDIRPREFIX, MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX
              If eigher of the two variable is set, it is used as the prefix of BSD-style
              objdir.  The former is given priority. The default is ´/usr/obj´.

CONFIGURATION
       The following configuration variables affect the execution of global:

       icase_path (boolean)
              Ignore case distinctions in pattern.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Global exits with a non-0 value if an error occurred, 0 otherwise.
