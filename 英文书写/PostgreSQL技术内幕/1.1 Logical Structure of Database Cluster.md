Chapter1 Database Cluster, Databases, and Tables

## 1.1 Logical Structure of Database Cluster

A **database cluster** is a collection of databases managed by a PostgreSQL server. If you hear this definition now for the first time, you might be wondering about it, but the 'database cluster' in PostgreSQL does not mean 'a group of database servers'. A PosrtgreSQL server runs on a single host and manages a single database cluster.

Figure1.1 shows the logical structure of a database cluster. A database is a collection of database objects. In the relational database theory, a database  object is a data structure used either to store or to reference data. A (heap) table is a typical exmaple of it, and there are many more like an index, a sequence, a view, a function and so on. In PostreSQL, database themselves are also database objects and are logically separated from each other.
